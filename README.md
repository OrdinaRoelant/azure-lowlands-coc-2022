# uptime-conference-2022
Uptime Conference 2022 - the conference on open source data in the cloud. The event is designed for developers, architects, data engineers, DevOps professionals, and anyone who wants to learn about open source data tools, such as PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, Redis, Apache Flink, Grafana, and more. 

Uptime aims to bring the open source data community together to share best practices and learn how to build and operate complex systems at scale. Uptime is planned to be a hybrid event and we encourage speakers to submit their ideas whether you plan your talk to be virtual or in-person.
